   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bmkitstarter.git
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd bmkitstarter
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/douglasporto/bmkitstarter.git
   ```

   message guidelines](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
